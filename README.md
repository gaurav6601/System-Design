<h3>HTTP</h3><br>
1.Client/Server - self exlpinatory<br>
2.Stateless - HTTP is called as a stateless protocol because each request is executed independently, without any knowledge of the <br>requests that were executed before it, which means once the transaction ends the connection between the browser and the server is also lost<br>
3.Application Layer -- its present in Application layer above Transport Layer<br>
4.Client-Actions - refer Image below<br>
<img src="../Src/HTTP-Actions.png"><br>
5.Server Codes-<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status"></a><br>
6. Headers - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers"></a><br>
these are like client wants a text file,xml file,json file so it would include in content type header<br>
similarly server would also send that<br>
